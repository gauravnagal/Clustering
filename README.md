# Clustering Example

## Data Generation Script for Clustering

#### Part 01:
- Use Data Generation script to create sample data for using clustering algorithms to determine clusters for both examples. Algorithms to use:  
    - KMeans
    - DBScan
    - Choice of others that works best.
    
- Train a TensorFlow classifier to take a point in a two dimensional plane and classify it as one of the clusters from KMeans.
